smoke hovered over its end It was a new truck shining red and in twelve inch letters on its sides OKLAHOMA CITY TRANSPORT COMPANY Its double tires were new and a brass padlock stood straight out from the hasp on the big black doors Inside the screened restaurant a radio played quiet dance music turned low the way it is when no one is listening A small outlet fan turned silently in its circular hole over the entrance and flies buzzed excitedly about the doors and windows butting the screens Inside one man the truck driver sat on a stool and rested his elbows on the counter and looked over his coffee at the lean and lonely waitress He talked the smart listless language of the roadsides to her I seen him about three months ago He had a operation Cut somepin out I forget what And she Doesn't seem no longer than a week I seen him myself Looked fine then He's a nice sort of a guy when he ain't stinko Now and then the flies roared softly at the screen door The coffee machine spurted steam and the waitress without looking reached behind her and shut it off Outside a man walking along the edge of the highway crossed over and approached the truck He walked slowly to the front of it put his hand on the shiny fender and looked at the No Riders sticker on the windshield For a moment he was about to walk on down the road but instead he sat on the running board on the side away from the restaurant He was not over thirty His eyes were very dark brown and there was a hint of brown pigment in his eyeballs His cheek bones were high and wide and strong deep lines cut down his cheeks in curves beside his mouth His upper lip was long and since his teeth protruded the lips stretched to cover them for this man kept his lips closed His hands were hard with broad fingers and nails as thick and ridged as little clam shells The space between thumb and forefinger and the hams of his hands were shiny with callus
